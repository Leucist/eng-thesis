# Echo of Memory *(working title)*

> A narrative 2D side-view stealth-action game about memory, decay, and a hero with a quiet past.  
> Built from scratch in pure C# and SFML using a custom ECS-like architecture and TDD approach.

## 💡 Overview

This project aims to build a side-scrolling game with rich narrative elements, atmospheric storytelling, and stealth-based mechanics.  
The setting draws from post-cyberpunk and minimalistic medieval aesthetics, with an AI-driven mystery at the core.

## 🛠️ Structure

- `Application/` – Main game application, core logic, ECS architecture
- `Application.Tests/` – Tests, built using a TDD-first approach
- `Application.sln` – Solution file

## 🧪 Development

The project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** wherever feasible.  
Early focus is on building a stable and modular ECS foundation.

### Technologies:

- C# (.NET 8)
- SFML.Net
- xUnit (testing framework)

## 📜 License
